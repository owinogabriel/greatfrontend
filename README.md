# GreatFrontEnd Projects 🚀

Welcome to my personal collection of frontend challenges from [GreatFrontEnd](https://www.greatfrontend.com/). This repo is dedicated to improving my UI/UX, accessibility, and frontend coding skills through practical, real-world projects.

## 💡 Motivation

As a passionate Frontend Developer, I'm constantly learning and pushing myself to build better, more accessible, and maintainable interfaces. GreatFrontEnd challenges offer a structured, hands-on way to sharpen my skills and gain confidence in my frontend workflow.

This repository is a reflection of:
- 📈 My learning journey
- 💻 My commitment to clean, modern UI development
- ⚙️ My growth in JavaScript/TypeScript, React,Nextjs and CSS frameworks

## 🧱 Tech Stack

Most projects here are built using:
- **React** with **TypeScript** and **Nextjs**
- **TailwindCSS**
- **Vite** (or Next.js for larger apps)
- Accessibility & semantic HTML best practices

## 📁 Project Structure

Each challenge has its own folder:


Each project contains a `README.md`, screenshots, and setup instructions where necessary.

## 🌐 Live Demos

Whenever possible, I deploy my solutions for easy viewing. Live links can be found in each project's README.
